# Mini-Doc-App

Mini-Doc-App is a simple React application that displays documents as cards on the landing page. Each card shows a brief description of the document and indicates whether it has been downloaded. The application includes drag-and-drop functionality for the cards using Framer Motion, and the styling is done with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Document Cards**: Displays documents as cards with descriptions and download status.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Cards can be dragged around the landing page with constraints to stay within the screen boundaries.
- **Sample Data**: Uses sample data for rendering cards. Future updates will make the app dynamic by fetching data from a backend.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Framer Motion**: For adding drag-and-drop animation and constraints.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components.

- Node.js (v14 or later)
